# PDF Information Retrieval System - Technical Approach

## Overview

This system implements an advanced document processing and information retrieval pipeline designed to extract the most relevant sections from PDF documents based on user personas and specific tasks. The approach combines multiple AI techniques including semantic search, cross-encoder reranking, and weak supervision learning to achieve high-quality results.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Configuration Management
- **Pydantic Schema Validation**: Uses structured configuration with `DocumentConfig` and `InputConfig` classes
- **Input Format**: JSON-based configuration specifying documents, persona, and job requirements
- **Validation**: Automatic validation of input parameters to ensure data integrity

### 2. Enhanced PDF Text Extraction

#### Multi-Layer Text Extraction Strategy
The system employs a robust, multi-fallback approach to handle various PDF types:

**Primary Extraction (pdfplumber)**:
- Uses multiple tolerance settings for optimal text extraction
- Handles both text-based and image-based PDFs
- Character-by-character extraction as fallback

**OCR Fallback**:
- Optional OCR integration with pytesseract and pdf2image
- Graceful degradation when OCR dependencies are unavailable
- Error handling for failed OCR attempts

**Structured Content Detection**:
- Table extraction and conversion to text format
- List detection (bullets, numbered, lettered)
- Figure caption extraction for additional context

#### Text Enhancement Pipeline
```
Raw PDF Text → Whitespace Normalization → Boilerplate Removal → 
OCR Error Correction → Glossary Expansion → Clean Text
```

**Key Cleaning Operations**:
- Whitespace normalization and pagination removal
- Common OCR error corrections (l→I, 0→O)
- Acronym expansion using domain-specific glossary
- Copyright notice and metadata removal

### 3. Advanced Section Detection

#### Multi-Pattern Heading Recognition
The system uses comprehensive regex patterns to identify document sections:

- **ALL CAPS headings**: `^([A-Z][A-Z\s]{4,})$`
- **Numbered sections**: `^(\d+\.?\s+[A-Z][A-Za-z\s]{3,})$`
- **Title Case headings**: `^([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+){1,4})$`
- **Chapter/Section markers**: `^(CHAPTER\s+\d+[:\.\s].)$`

#### Intelligent Content Segmentation
- Position-based sorting of detected headings
- Content boundary detection between sections
- Minimum content length validation (>50 characters)
- Fallback to page-level sections when no headings detected

### 4. Multi-Query Retrieval System

#### Query Variant Generation
The system automatically generates multiple query variants to improve retrieval coverage:

**Base Query Types**:
- Direct persona-task combinations
- Need-based formulations
- Help-seeking variations

**Enhanced Queries**:
- Time-based extractions (numbers + time periods)
- Location-specific queries
- Group-oriented searches

**Example for Travel Planning**:
- "Travel Planner needs to plan a 4-day trip for 10 college friends"
- "4 day itinerary plan"
- "travel guide south france"
- "group travel planning friends"

#### Semantic Search with Fusion
```
Query Variants → Individual Rankings → Reciprocal Rank Fusion → Unified Ranking
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Sentence-BERT embeddings (`all-mpnet-base-v2`)
- Cosine similarity scoring
- Top-50 candidates per query variant
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for combining rankings

### 5. Cross-Encoder Reranking

#### Two-Stage Retrieval Architecture
1. **Retrieval Stage**: Fast semantic search using bi-encoders
2. **Reranking Stage**: Precise relevance scoring using cross-encoders

**Cross-Encoder Model**: `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`
- Processes query-document pairs jointly
- Higher computational cost but better accuracy
- Applied only to top candidates (typically 30)

### 6. Weak Supervision Learning

#### Pseudo-Label Generation
The system implements a novel weak supervision approach:

```python
threshold = np.percentile(cross_encoder_scores, 70)  # Top 30% as positive
pseudo_labels = [1 if score > threshold else 0 for score in scores]
```

#### Lightweight Classification
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Maximum 1000 features with English stop words
- **Logistic Regression**: Fast, interpretable binary classifier
- **Training Data**: Pseudo-labels from cross-encoder scores

#### Score Fusion
```
final_score = α × weak_supervision_score + (1-α) × cross_encoder_score
```
Where α = 0.3 (empirically determined weight)

### 7. Contextual Section Enhancement

#### Neighbor Discovery
The system adds contextual sections by including:
- Adjacent sections from the same document
- Sections from nearby pages (±1 page range)
- Maximum limit of 20 sections to prevent information overload

#### Smart Content Refinement
For subsection analysis, the system applies sentence-level scoring:
- Sentence segmentation using punctuation markers
- Individual sentence embedding and scoring
- Top-3 sentence selection for refined text generation

## Output Structure

### Extracted Sections Format
```json
{
  "document": "filename.pdf",
  "section_title": "Detected Section Title",
  "importance_rank": 1,
  "page_number": 5
}
```

### Subsection Analysis Format
```json
{
  "document": "filename.pdf",
  "refined_text": "Most relevant sentences...",
  "page_number": 5
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity
- **Text Extraction**: O(n) where n = number of pages
- **Section Detection**: O(m) where m = number of text blocks
